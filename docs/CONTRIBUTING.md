**Getting started with the database:**
1. Head over to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and create a project, get the credidentials 
2. Go to the ```.env.example``` file where you can update the boiler text, as well as rename ```.env.example to .env```
3. Run ```yarn``` or ```yarn install``` to install all required packages 
4. Build/start the application by running ```yarn dev```

**Getting started with OAuth:**
1. Head over to your firebase console
2. On the sidebar, click "Authentication" and go to the "Sign-in Method" tab
3. Now scroll to where it says "GitHub" and click it
4. If it's disabled click "enable", then go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/developers">GitHub's Developer Settings</a> and click "New OAuth App" at the top right
5. Next make a OAuth App and fill in the fields, and get the ```Client ID + Client Secret```, go back to Firebase
6. Make sure you have the credidentials copied, paste them into Firebase

**Important Notes:**
- We are using Firebase Firestore for the database
- Everytime you change the .env file, you need to restart the server
- We are using Yarn as our package manager, please do not commit your ```package-lock.json``` files from NPM
- Make sure you are upto date by doing ```git pull``` here and there
